// UNITY C# STYLE GUIDE:
// | The '// |'-style comments denote documentation markup.

// KEY PRINCIPLES
// | Favor readability over brevity. Clarity is more important than any time saved from omitting a few vowels.
// | The goal is to make your code more readable, maintainable, and consistent.
// | Doing things like naming right from the beginning will save you time and effort later. 
// | Particularly when debugging, and extending functionality.
// | As much as possible stick to industry standards and conventions. However, be pragmatic. 
// | Building on above, a code style standard is a living document. 
// | It should be updated as the project evolves and the team grows.
// | However, as a beginner, keep your guidelines light. 
// | The most important thing is to write code that works before making it "clean". 
// | Code style is a personal preference. The most important thing is to be consistent. 
// | If you have a team, agree on a style guide and stick to it.
// | Favor what can be pronounced naturally and readability 
// | e.g. HorizontalAlignment instead of AlignmentHorizontal (more English-readable)

// NAMING
// | This one deserves a repeat: Favor readability over brevity. 
// | Clarity is more important than any time saved from omitting a few vowels.
// | Pick meaningful names from the beginning to minimize refactoring later.
// | Variable names should be descriptive, clear, and unambiguous because they represent a thing or state.
// | Use a noun when naming them except when the variable is of the type bool.
// | Prefix Booleans with a verb to make their meaning more apparent. e.g. isDead, isWalking, hasDamageMultiplier.
// | Use meaningful names. Don’t abbreviate (unless it’s math or commonly accepted). Your variable names should reveal their intent. 
// | Choose identifier names that are easily readable. 
// | For example, a property named HorizontalAlignment is more readable than AlignmentHorizontal.
// | Make type names unambiguous across namespaces and problem domains by avoiding common terms 
// | or adding a prefix or a suffix. (ex. use 'PhysicsSolver', not 'Solver')

// CASING AND PREFIXES:
// | Use Pascal case (e.g. ExamplePlayerController, MaxHealth, etc.) unless noted otherwise.
// | Use Camel case for variable names
// | Avoid snake case, kebab case, Hungarian notation.
// | If you have a Monobehaviour in a file, the source file name must match.
// | Alternatively, some guides suggest adding a prefix to private member variables
// | with an underscore (_) to differentiate them from local variables.
// | Specify access level modifiers consistently. 
// | Private/Public/Static
// | Avoid redundant names: If your class is called Player, you don’t need to create member variables called PlayerScore or PlayerTarget. 
// | Trim them down to Score or Target.

// FORMATTING:
// | Allman (opening curly braces on a new line) style braces.
// | Readability is key. Try to keep lines short. Consider horizontal whitespace. 
// | Break a long line into smaller statements rather than letting it overflow.
// | Avoid spaces inside brackets, e.g. x = dataArray[index].

// SPACING:
// | Use a single space after a comma between function arguments, e.g. CollectItem(myObject, 0, 1);
// | Don’t add a space after the parenthesis and function arguments, e.g. CollectItem(myObject, 0, 1);
// | Don’t use spaces between a function name and parenthesis, e.g. DropPowerUp(myPrefab, 0, 1);
// | Use vertical spacing (extra blank line) for visual separation, e.g. for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) { DoSomething(i); }
// | Use one variable declaration per line unless the variables are related or equivalent, e.g.  int x, y = 10;
// | Don’t use spaces between a function name and parenthesis, e.g. DropPowerUp(myPrefab, 0, 1);

// COMMENTS:
// | Comment when needed. That is when the code isn’t self-explanatory and needs clarification beyond good naming revealing the intent.
// | However, if you need to add a comment to explain a convoluted tangle of logic, consider restructuring your code to be more obvious. 
// | Good naming can take out the guesswork. Consider renaming before commenting.  
// | Rather than simply answering "what" or "how," comments can fill in the gaps and tell us "why."
// | Use the // comment to keep the explanation next to the logic.
// | Use a Tooltip instead of a comment for serialized fields if your fields in the Inspector need explanation. 
// | Avoid attributions, e.g. // Created by, // Modified by, etc. Use version control to track changes.
// | Documenting the 'why' is far more important than the 'what' or 'how'.

// | CLASS ORGANIZATION:
// | Organize your class in the following order: Fields, Properties, Events, 
// | Monobehaviour methods (Awake, Start, OnEnable, OnDisable, OnDestroy, etc.), public methods, private, methods, other Classes.

// USING LINES:
// | Keep using lines at the top of your file.
// | Don't remove unused using lines, VS code will often mistakingly tell you they're unneccessary.
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using System;

// NAMESPACES:
// | Use namespaces to ensure that your classes, interfaces, enums, etc. 
// | won’t conflict with existing ones from other namespaces or the global namespace.
// | Use Pascal case, without special symbols or underscores.
// | Add using line at the top to avoid typing namespace repeatedly.
// | Some recommend namespaces that reflect the folder structure of the project so it's logically grouped.

namespace UnityCSharpStyleSheetExample
{
    // ENUMS:
    // | Use enums when an object or action can only have one value at a time.
    // | Use Pascal case for enum names and values.
    // | Use a singular noun for the enum name as it represents a single value from a set of possible values. 
    // | They should have no prefix or suffix.
    // | You can place public enums outside of a class to make them global.
    public enum Direction
    {
        North,
        South,
        East,
        West,
    }
}

// CLASSES or STRUCTS:
// | Use Pascal case 
// | Name them with nouns or noun phrases. This distinguishes type names from methods, which are named with verb phrases.
// | Avoid prefixes.
// | One Monobehaviour per file. If you have a Monobehaviour in a file, the source file name must match. 
    public class StyleExample : MonoBehaviour
    {
    }

        // FIELDS: 
        // | Avoid special characters (backslashes, symbols, Unicode characters); these can interfere with command line tools.
        // | Use nouns for names, but prefix booleans with a verb.
        // | Use meaningful names. Make names searchable and pronounceable. Don’t abbreviate (unless it’s math).
        // | Use Pascal case for public fields. Use camel case for private variables.
        // | Specify (or omit) the default private access modifier but do it consistently. 
        // | We recommend to leave out things that are implicit and thus redundant (such as private) for simplicity 
        // | if you agree that it doesn't negatively affect ambiguity or readability for you.

        // Some prefer to leave out using any prefix for private fields and specifying the access modifier as below 
        private int elapsedTimeInHours;

        // Use [SerializeField] attribute if you want to display a private field in Inspector.
        // Booleans ask a question that can be answered true or false.
        [SerializeField] private bool isPlayerDead;

        // Static fields are static
        static int sharedCount; 

        // Constants are const
        const int maxCount = 100;

        // Use the Range attribute to set minimum and maximum values. 
        // This limits the values to a Range and creates a slider in the Inspector.
        [Range(0f, 1f)] [SerializeField] float rangedStat;

        // A tooltip can replace a comment on a serialized field and do double duty.
        [Tooltip("This is another statistic for the player.")]
        [SerializeField] float anotherStat;

        // PROPERTIES:
        // | Pascal case, without special characters.
        // | Use the expression-bodied properties to shorten, but choose your preferrred format.
        // | E.g. use expression-bodied for read-only properties but { get; set; } for everything else.
        // | Use the Auto-Implementated Property for a public property without a backing field.
        // | While you can also use functions to expose private data properties are generally recommended.
        // | For get or set operations involving complex logic or computation, use methods instead of properties.

        // explicitly implement getter and setter if field should not be public
        public int MaxHealth
        {
            get => m_maxHealth;
            set => m_maxHealth = value;
        }
        // EVENTS:
        // | Name with a verb phrase.
        // | Present participle means "before" and past participle means "after."
        // | Use System.Action delegate for most events (can take 0 to 16 parameters).
        // | Use the System.EventHandler;
        // | Choose a naming scheme for events, event handling methods (listener/trigger), 
        // | and event raising methods (trigger/object)
        // | e.g. event/action = "OpeningDoor", event raising method = "OnDoorOpened", event handling method = "MySubject_DoorOpened"
   
        // Event before
        public event Action OpeningDoor;

        // Event after
        public event Action DoorOpened;     

        // Event with int parameter
        public event Action<int> PointsScored;
        
        // Custom event with custom EventArgs
        public event Action<CustomEventArgs> ThingHappened;

        // These are event raising methods, e.g. OnDoorOpened, OnPointsScored, etc.
        // Prefix the event raising method (in the subject) with “On”.
        
        public void OnDoorOpened()
        {
            DoorOpened?.Invoke();
        }

        // METHODS:
        // | While “function” and “method” are often used interchangeably, method is the right term in Unity development
        // | because you can’t write a function without incorporating it into a class in C#.
        // | Start a method name with a verb or verb phrases to show an action. Add context if necessary. e.g. GetDirection, FindTarget, etc.
        // | Methods returning bool should ask questions: Much like Boolean variables themselves.
        // | Prefix methods with a verb if they return a true-false condition. 
        // | This phrases them in the form of a question, e.g. IsGameOver, HasStartedTurn
        // | Use camel case for parameters. Format parameters passed into the method like local variables.

        // | SOME GENERAL TIPS FOR METHODS:
        // | Avoid long methods. If a method is too long, consider breaking it into smaller methods.
        // | Avoid methods with too many parameters. If a method has more than three parameters, 
        // | consider using a class or struct to group them.
        // | Avoid excessive overloading: You can generate an endless permutation of method overloads.
        // | Avoid side effects: A method only needs to do what its name advertises.
        // | A good name for a method reflects what it does.
        // | Avoid setting up methods to work in multiple different modes based on a flag. 
        // | Make two methods with distinct names instead, e.g. GetAngleInDegrees and GetAngleInRadians. 

        // Methods start with a verb.
        public void SetInitialPosition(float x, float y, float z)
        {
            transform.position = new Vector3(x, y, z);
        }

        // Methods ask a question when they return bool.
        public bool IsNewPosition(Vector3 newPosition)
        {
            return (transform.position == newPosition);
        }

        void FormatExamples(int someExpression)
        {
            // VAR:
            // | While avoiding ambiguity and always looking for ways to improve readability, 
            // | you can use var  when the type is clear from the context,
            // | With good naming ambiguity should be less of an issue because variable names already convey the intent.  
            // | Refactoring is simpler with var since it abstracts away the specific type, 
            // | reducing the number of places where code needs to be updated when types change.  
            // | In foreach loops, var ensures that the iteration variable matches the type provided by the enumerator. 
            // | If you explicitly declare a mismatched type, the compiler may allow it, leading to runtime errors.

            var powerUps = new List<PlayerStats>();
            var dict = new Dictionary<string, List<GameObject>>();

            // SWITCH STATEMENTS:
            // | It’s generally advisable to replace longer if-else chains with a switch statement for better readability.
            // | The formatting can vary. Select one for your style guide and follow it.
            // | This example indents each case and the break underneath.
            switch (someExpression)
            {
                case 0:
                    // ..
                    break;
                case 1:
                    // ..
                    break;
                case 2:

                    break;
            }

            // BRACES: 
            // | Where possible, don’t omit braces, even for single-line statements. 
            // | Or avoid single-line statements entirely for debuggability.
            // | Keep braces in nested multi-line statements.

            // This single-line statement keeps the braces...
            for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) { DoSomething(i); }

            // ... but this is more reable and often more debuggable. 
            for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
            {
                DoSomething(i);
            }

            // Separate the statements for readability.
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            {
                for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++)

    // OTHER CLASSES:
    // | Define as many other helper/non-Monobehaviour classes in your file as needed.
    // | This is a serializable class that groups fields in the Inspector.
